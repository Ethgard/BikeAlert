BikeAlert is designed to solve the electrical bike and battery theft in urban cities around the world. Furthermore, our solution presents live information on battery level. Our solution senses suspicious movement on the battery and notifies the user in case of theft, and presents real-time battery voltage data on a special Android application.
The system is built of multiple modules forming this unique interaction:
Microchip PIC16F1782 – a strong microprocessor which calls the main loop and samples the data from the other modules.
HC-05 Bluetooth Module – communication unit with the Android application.
Analog Devices ADXL345 – 3-axis accelerometer.
Android BikeAlert application.
